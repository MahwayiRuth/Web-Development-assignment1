# My Web Development Journey

Hi there! 👋

This is my first HTML-only web page. I made it as part of my learning to understand how to build websites using just HTML5 — no CSS, no JavaScript, just the basics done right.

## 🌱 Why I Made This

I wanted to learn how to create a real web page using proper structure and meaningful tags. I also learned that making websites isn't just about how they look, but also about making them easy to read — for people *and* for search engines.

This project helped me practice:

- Using HTML5 semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Keeping things organized with the right heading levels (like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>`)
- Adding accessibility features like `aria-labels` and landmarks
- Writing useful descriptions and titles for SEO

## 📄 What's On the Page

- An introduction about me
- What I’ve learned so far
- A small description of this project
- A way to contact me by email

Everything is written in plain HTML. No styling or interactivity yet — I’ll add those as I learn more!

## ✅ What I Learned

- HTML tags are more than just boxes — they tell browsers and screen readers what each part of the page means
- Accessibility is important, even for small projects like this
- Good structure helps search engines understand your content better
- You don’t need fancy tools to build something meaningful

## 🚫 What This Page Doesn’t Have (Yet)

- ❌ No CSS (so it might look very plain)
- ❌ No JavaScript
- ❌ No images or colors

That’s all on purpose! This is just about getting the structure right first.

## 🧠 Meta Tags Included

To help with SEO (search engine optimization), I added:

- `<meta name="description">` – describes what the page is about
- `<meta name="keywords">` – helpful terms a search engine might use
- `<meta name="author">` – just my name
- `<title>` – the page title you see in the browser tab
